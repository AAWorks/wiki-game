    <p>Dogs are  <a href="/wiki/Mammal">mammals</a>, usually kept as pets
      or for work on farms or police. Some dogs are trained to be rescue
      dogs, and join teams such as mountain rescue. They have been bred by
      humans from their ancestral wolves. They were the first animals to
      live with humans, as far as we know.</p>
