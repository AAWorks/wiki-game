    <p>An organism is an individual living thing. It is easy to
    recognize a living thing, but not so easy to define
    it. <a href="/wiki/Animal" title="Animal">Animals</a> and plants
    are organisms, obviously. Organisms are a biotic, or living, part
    of the environment. Rocks and sunshine are parts of the non-living
    environment. </p>
